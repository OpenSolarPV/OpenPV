# Open Photovoltaics Toolkit(OpenPV)

![openpv](/features/openpv.jpg)

## Introduction

OpenPV is an open source toolbox for solar photovoltaics semantic segmentation.









This project contains several preprocessing tools built by python:

* Building life pattern tree from raw GPS trajectory data.
* Preprocessing tools are used for the generation model of the "pseudo life pattern." 
* Essential preprocessing tools for converting raw GPS data to grid-based data format.
* Pseudo life pattern to the spatial sequence of trips.
* Map-matching as post-processing of GPS trajectory.


## Usage
Please refer to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the necessary python library.
