# Open Urban Mobility Toolkit (OpenMob)

This project contains several preprocessing tools built by python:
* Building life pattern tree from raw GPS trajectory data.
* Preprocessing tools are used for the generation model of the "pseudo life pattern." 
* Essential preprocessing tools for converting raw GPS data to grid-based data format.
* Pseudo life pattern to the spatial sequence of trips.
* Map-matching as post-processing of GPS trajectory.


## Usage
Please refer to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the necessary python library.
