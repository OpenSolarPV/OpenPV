# Open Photovoltaics Toolkit(OpenPV)

![openpv](features/openpv.jpg)

## Introduction

OpenPV is an open source toolbox for solar photovoltaics semantic segmentation.

![openpv](features/teaser.png)

Major features

- **Unified Benchmark**

  We provide a unified benchmark toolbox for various semantic segmentation methods.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the semantic segmentation framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized semantic segmentation framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple methods out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary semantic segmentation frameworks, *e.g.* PSPNet, DeepLabV3, PSANet, DeepLabV3+, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases.
